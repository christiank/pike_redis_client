# redis_client.pmod

This is a Redis client implemented as a Pike module. I noticed that the
[list of clients][1] on Redis' website was lacking a Pike implementation,
and since I've recently decided to learn Pike, I thought I'd contribute
this.

The design of this library is primarily inspired by that of [the popular
Ruby gem][2] -- object-oriented, that is.

NOTE! **This code is not 100% ready.** It works but I don't know if
everything works. I also have no clue _how_ idiomatically Pike it is -- I've
just started learning the language. I promise I'll let everyone know when
I'm finally OK with this code. Most notably, there is no support for command
pipelining nor asynchronous execution just yet.


## Example

    include .redis_client;

    int main() {
      Redis db;
      
      db = Redis();
      db->connect();
      db->ping();
      db->echo("Hello, Redis -- from Pike");

      db->lpush("characters", "Marten");
      db->lpush("characters", "Dora");
      db->lpush("characters", "Hannelore");
      write("There are %d characters\n", db->llen("characters"));

      db->disconnect();
      return 0;
    }
